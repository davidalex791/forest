If Windows (10/11) is making the Java application's windows too small,
not taking account of system DPI scaling, do this:

Right click on
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath\java.exe

Choose Properties

Compatibility tab

Click on "Change high DPI settings", which opens a sub-dialogue

Near the bottom: Check "Override high DPI scaling behaviour"
and also change the drop-down from "Application" to "System"

Click OK to go back to the main properties dialogue.

Apply and then OK
