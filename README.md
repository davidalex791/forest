# forest
Java demonstration of the Relf Terrain Generator, in the form of a partial conversion of The Forest from Javascript. Partial because this is work in progress. You can explore the terrain both above and under ground but not yet enter buildings or run orienteering courses (coming soon).
The zip file contains complete sources, the built JAR file you should be able to run, and all of the images required when the program runs. The licence is MIT because I really want people to use my algorithms and take then further.
I am just a hobbyist these days (retired) so you only require Java SE8 for compiling the sources.
The class net.grelf.forest.Terrain is the generator for above ground. You can find the underground generator in net.grelf.forest.Mine and you should see that complicated dungeon layouts can be made extremely simply and fast.
